                                                and Asian. The ears of African elephants are much larger than their cousins

                                            <dd>Elephants have around 150,000 muscle units in their trunk. Their trunks are
                                                perhaps the most sensitive organ found in any mammal - Asian elephants have
                                                been seen to pick up a peanut, shell it, blow the shell out and eat the nut.

                                                elephants are around 2 years old. Tusks continue growing throughout their
